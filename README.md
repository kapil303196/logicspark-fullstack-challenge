# Real-time Geo-tagging Image Sharing Platform

![Company Logo](http://logicspark.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PNG_02.png)

This is a real-time Geo-tagging Image Sharing Platform built using FrontEnd of Your Choice, Node.js, and MongoDB. The platform allows users to share images they've taken at different locations and view images shared by others at the same or different locations.

## Features

- **User Registration/Login**: Users can create a new account, log into the system using their credentials, and log out when done.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images from their device, which are securely and efficiently stored.
- **Geo-tagging**: Each uploaded image is tagged with the user's current geographical location, with the user's permission.
- **Image Display**: The main page displays a real-time feed of images uploaded by users.
- **Image Filtering**: Users can filter the image feed based on location and see images tagged at a specific location.
- **Real-time Updates**: New images matching the current filter automatically appear in the feed without requiring a page refresh.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: The application should perform all the required features correctly.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, organized, and commented, following good coding practices.
- **Database Design**: The MongoDB database should be well-designed with correct entity relations (Users, Images, Locations).
- **User Interface**: The application should be user-friendly and intuitive, with the UI reflecting the current state of the application.
- **Error Handling**: The application should handle errors gracefully and be free from security vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: The application should respond quickly to requests and handle large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Note**: Please do not fork this repository directly.

## Bonus Challenge

For a bonus challenge, you can implement a 'like' feature for images. Users can like other users' images and view the number of likes on their own images. This is not required, but completing it demonstrates a higher level of proficiency.

## Submission

To submit your solution, please provide the following:

1. Complete source code.
2. Link to the live demo of the application.
3. Brief documentation explaining your design decisions and how to run the application locally.
